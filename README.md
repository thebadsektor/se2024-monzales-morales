# SD-3101 ATTENDANCE TRACKING SYSTEM

![alt text](BANNER.jpg)

This PHP attendance system project is designed to manage student attendance and records effectively. It features three main sections: Admin Panel, Student Panel, and Teacher's Panel. The admin can create users and manage data, while teachers can track attendance for their subjects, and students can view their attendance records.

## Introduction
This project aims to simplify attendance management in educational institutions by providing a user-friendly interface for admins, teachers, and students.

## Project Overview
The system is targeted at schools and universities, providing a reliable way to track student attendance, generate reports, and manage user data.

## Objectives
Develop a solution for efficient attendance tracking.
Implement user roles and permissions.
Test and validate the system for usability and reliability.

## Features
List the main features of the project:
- Feature 1: Brief description.
- Feature 2: Brief description.
- Feature 3: Brief description.

## Technologies Used
PHP
Frameworks/Libraries: Bootstrap for UI
Databases: MySQL
Other Tools: Git for version control

## Setup and Installation
Step-by-step instructions for setting up the project locally.
Step 1: The initial step in this process involves ensuring the installation of
the Git Command Line Interface (CLI) on the computing device that will be
employed. This installation is a prerequisite, as the Git CLI is an essential
tool required for the entirety of this procedure. The absence of this tool on the
machine would impede any further progression in the development process.
Additionally, the Git CLI will be utilized for the critical task of cloning the
relevant repository.

 Installation of Git CLI.

Step 2: Upon successful installation of the Git CLI, the next step involves
identifying a repository that closely mirrors the intended application system,
specifically an "Attendance Checker Application System." This repository must
then be cloned into a designated file location within the local hard drive of the
computing device being used.

 Copying and cloning the repository

 Copying and cloning the repository

Step 3: Following the completion of the cloning process, the subsequent phase
entails executing and testing the cloned repository. This step is crucial in
determining the functionality of all included components. Moreover, it is
necessary to evaluate the compatibility of the programming languages and
technologies employed within the repository against those available in our
development environment. This assessment is critical in determining the relevance
of our prior knowledge and will streamline the subsequent setup process.

 Setup of the repository in XAMPP/PHPMyAdmin

Step 4: The testing phase serves as a pivotal point in ascertaining whether the
acquired repository is appropriate for the development of the intended
application system and whether it aligns with the theoretical and practical
knowledge acquired throughout our studies. For instance, it is imperative to
assess our familiarity with the programming languages and tools utilized in the
repository. This evaluation extends to any Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs) or supplementary applications that may be required.

 Testing Phase

Final Step: The concluding step involves updating the project tracker to document
and monitor our progress throughout the development process. This practice
ensures systematic tracking and facilitates effective project management.

 Updating the Tracker to monitor the progress

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev-mhrony/Student-Attendance-System01.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
	
3. **Configure environment variables (if any)**: Provide instructions for setting up .env files or any other required configurations.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev-mhrony/Student-Attendance-System01.git
   ```
4. **Run the project:**
   - For web projects:
   ```bash
  php -S localhost:8000

   ```

## Usage Instructions

Access the application:
- After setup, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.
Log in using the provided credentials.
